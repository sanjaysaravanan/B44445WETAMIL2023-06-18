Till now, we have seen the setup for React.

Why React:
  Multi Page Application:
    Multiple HTML Pages which downloads the same resources again

    Disadvantage:
      loading all resources ( images, css, js, fonts )
  
  Single Page Application( React JS ):
    Single HTML File served and DOM Manipulation with JS


React:
  Structure of React & Folder Structure

  how to code inside React-JS

  webpack is bundler used to combine all the node_modules used and assets( image, css )

  babeljs conversion of jsx to normal js as well conversion browser understandable js
    js with html called as jsx ( Javascript xtensible )

  How Single Page App Can Work:
    VDOM -> Virtual DOM

    We should only rely on Virtual DOM Manipulation

    ****** We should not use document object ******
      document.getElementById, document.createElement ...etc all are not allowed in react

  using,

    module import & export
  
    js, html
      className instead of class ( class is a keyword in js )
      htmlFor instead of for (for is keyword in JS)

      {} is used to use variable or expression inside jsx

    css
